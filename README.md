# FIFO-development-and-UVM-Verification
This is a Constrained-Random UVM Verification of a Synchronous FIFO with Scoreboard, Coverage &amp; Assertions


A FIFO (First-In First-Out) buffer ensures that data is read in the same order it is written.
This project verifies FIFO behavior using a full UVM environment and SystemVerilog Assertions.

FIFO Features

8-bit data width

4-entry depth

Write/Read enable logic

Full & Empty flag generation

Pointer & count-based control

Verified Scenarios

Random read/write sequences

Overflow condition (write when full)

Underflow condition (read when empty)

Reset functionality

Data integrity (order maintained)

Coverage and scoreboard checks
