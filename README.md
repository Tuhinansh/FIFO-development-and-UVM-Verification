# FIFO-development-and-UVM-Verification
This is a Constrained-Random UVM Verification of a Synchronous FIFO with Scoreboard, Coverage &amp; Assertions



This project focuses on the RTL design and verification of a synchronous FIFO (First-In First-Out) memory buffer using SystemVerilog
A complete RTL design and constrained-random UVM verification environment for a synchronous FIFO (First-In First-Out) memory module. The project demonstrates industry-standard verification practices using SystemVerilog, including functional coverage, assertions, scoreboard-based checking, and reusable UVM components.

🚀 Project Overview

This project implements and verifies an *8-bit wide, 4-depth synchronous FIFO* using modern verification methodologies. The FIFO acts as a temporary data buffer that stores and retrieves data in the same order it was written (FIFO principle). To ensure design correctness, a full *UVM environment* is built, capable of constrained-random testing, functional coverage measurement, assertion checking, and automated scoreboard comparison.

## 🔧 *Design Description (RTL)*

The FIFO RTL includes the following features:

* Parameterized *WIDTH* and *DEPTH*
* Internal memory array
* *Write pointer* and *read pointer*
* *Full* and *Empty* status flags
* Handles *write, **read, **simultaneous read/write, and **reset*

### *Key Design Operations*

| Operation | Behavior                                       |
| --------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Write     | Stores data at write pointer if FIFO not full  |
| Read      | Outputs data at read pointer if FIFO not empty |
| Full      | Asserted when FIFO cannot accept more data     |
| Empty     | Asserted when FIFO has no valid data           |

## 🧪 *UVM Verification Environment*

The testbench is built fully on UVM methodology, consisting of the following components:

### *1. Sequence Item*

Defines stimulus fields such as:

* write enable
* read enable
* write data
  Includes constraints to generate legal and illegal scenarios.

### *2. Sequence*

Generates constrained-random transactions for:

* Normal read/write
* Overflow attempt
* Underflow attempt
* Simultaneous operations

### *3. Driver*

Drives sequence items into the DUT using the interface signals.

### *4. Monitor*

Observes DUT activity and sends transactions to:

* Scoreboard
* Coverage collector

### *5. Scoreboard*

Implements a *reference model* to compare:

* Expected FIFO behavior
* Actual DUT outputs

Automatically flags mismatches.

### *6. Coverage*

Functional coverage tracks:

* Write/read events
* Full/empty conditions
* Corner cases (overflow, underflow)
* Data patterns

Ensures completeness of verification.

### *7. Assertions*

SystemVerilog assertions check:

* No read when FIFO is empty
* No write when FIFO is full
* Pointer update correctness
* Reset behavior

Assertions provide immediate bug detection.

### *8. Environment*

Creates and connects sequencer, driver, monitor, scoreboard, and coverage.

### *9. Test*

Instantiates the environment and configures:

* Constrained-random tests
* Directed tests
* Regression sweep

## 📝 *How to Run (EDA Playground / Simulator)*

### *Using EDA Playground*

1. Select *SystemVerilog* and *UVM 1.2*
2. Upload all files into the correct directories
3. Compile → Run
4. View logs and waveforms under "Transcript" and "Waves"

### *Using Questa/VCS*


vlog rtl/*.sv tb/*.sv assertions/*.sv
vsim -c tb -do "run -all"

## 📊 *Results*

The verification environment detects incorrect pointer updates, underflow/overflow bugs, and ensures FIFO operates correctly in all modes. The functional coverage reaches *100%* after running regression tests, confirming complete scenario testing.

---

## 🏁 *Conclusion*

This project demonstrates a complete RTL-to-validation flow of a synchronous FIFO using UVM methodology. It highlights the importance of reusable components, random stimulus, functional coverage, and assertion-based checking for high-quality digital design verification.
